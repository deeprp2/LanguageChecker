# LanguageChecker
In class we used a short program to count how many of each alphabetic character was found on an input line?  Then we modified it to read from Shakespear's Macbeth instead, counting how many of each letter there is in that document.  This led us to wonder how frequency counts data like that might be useful in other contexts, such as knowing which letters to guess next in a hangman word-guess game, or in decoding encrypted text.  Also wondered whether or not the letter frequency counts would work as a signature for a particular language, with the letter frequency counts functioning as a sort of bar-code for that language.  This is the program to explore exactly that question!
